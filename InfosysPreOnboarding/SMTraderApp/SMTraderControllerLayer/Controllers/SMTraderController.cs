// Slow, steady progress. 
// I've followed my first route to the end of the line, and now I'm going to start working on the next route after I get back
// from my I-9 certification appointment.
// I'm hard coding some data for now until I set up a database (AZURE SQL is annoying to set up)

// 11/17/2022
// DISCLAIMER: This is part of the pre-planning / re-remembering phase. This is not a working example. It is a work in progress.
// I always start with the controller layer, because it is the most visible layer. It is the layer that is most likely to change.
// I havent even started Models yet. I will get to that next! (Most would argue an even better place to start off!)
