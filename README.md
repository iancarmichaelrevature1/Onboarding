# Onboarding Project 1 Devlog

Started updating connection strings to match SQLite's requirments. I'm still having a lot of technical issues troubleshooting this extracurricular SQL solution.
I want to work on my Angular front end, but without a working back end, what's the point? 

My last day with Revature's the 30th. Maybe I can sort this all out by then?

Made my SQLite database. I'm going to use it to store the data for the Stocks. 
As per the assignment's suggestion, I am considering just having a *single* Stocks table with the following columns:
1. Stock Id (Primary Key) (INTEGER)
2. Stock Ticker Symbol (TEXT)
3. Price Per Share (REAL)
4. Number of Shares (INTEGER)
5. Market Cap (REAL)

I somewhat tragically mistook this day to be the 'end' of the assignment, and therefore I spent most of the day doing
assignments on the Project Onboarding event Calendar.

Later on, after realizing I am to continue my struggles, I spent time shopping around for local DB options and settled on SQLite.
Resolved to get SOMETHING up and running, I installed and began to learn to use SQLite in lieu of Azure SQL Server.

Trevin was SO right. PASSION is important. Boring projects are not the best way to learn and stay busy.
In the thick of it now, I'm struggling to muster up the energy to do this project, and I'm not sure why.
I think it's a mix of things: 
1. I was definitely not in the right headspace to be blind-sided by another revature training project.
   I realize the goal wasn't for us to get stressed out like it was training all over again, but it feels like a solo P3.
   I'm already stressed because I don't know where I'm going to LIVE in 2+ weeks, and because I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing once I get there!
   And of course Thanksgiving stress!!! I'm in charge of cooking! YIKES!
2. Trevin didn't say it was mandatory. I'm too easy on myself and I definitely work better with a serious deadline.
   While he did say it was a good idea to 'CYA' and do it, I still don't find that to be a good motivator. >>But that's on ME.<<
3. Azure SQL requires a subscription, and I don't have one. I was trained to use Azure SQL, 
   but Revature was paying for the subscription then, and isn't any longer... Frustrating.
4. For the first time in my life, I had to hardcode data into my project. I don't like doing that. But it was 
   the only way I could get the project to work. And it still doesn't work. At least for now.
I know I could complete this project with an extension, but my batchmate told us on 11/19, he was charged more than $300
for the Azure SQL subscription. Despite not using it! I'm about to move. I can't afford to forget and pay that kinda money.
Going to look into other options.

Slow, steady progress. 
I've followed my first route to the end of the line, and now I'm going to start working on the next route after I get back
from my I-9 certification appointment.
I'm hard coding some data for now until I set up a database (AZURE SQL is annoying to set up)

DISCLAIMER: This is part of the pre-planning / re-remembering phase. This is not a working example. It is a work in progress.
I always start with the controller layer, because it is the most visible layer. It is the layer that is most likely to change.
I havent even started Models yet. I will get to that next! (Most would argue an even better place to start off!)
